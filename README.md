# Car Rental System

## Overview

The Car Rental System is a C++ application that allows customers to rent cars from a fleet of available vehicles. It provides various functionalities for both customers and staff to manage car rentals efficiently.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Registration**
   - Customers can register an account by providing personal details, including name, contact information, and a valid identification document.

2. **Car Inventory**
   - The system maintains an inventory of available cars, including details such as the car's make, model, year of manufacture, rental price, and availability status.

3. **Car Booking**
   - Customers can select a car from the available options and make a booking by specifying the following:
     - Rental duration.
     - Pickup and drop-off locations.
     - Additional services (e.g., GPS, child seat).

4. **Booking Management**
   - Customers can:
     - View their bookings.
     - Modify bookings (with appropriate rules and policies).
     - Cancel bookings (with a refund policy).

5. **Cost Calculation**
   - The system calculates the total cost of a booking based on:
     - Rental duration.
